# Pinyin Converter

A library for converting Chinese characters to Pinyin.

## JSON Data Format

The library uses several JSON files for character-to-pinyin mapping:

- `pinyin-dict.json`: Maps Chinese characters to their pinyin pronunciations
- `word-pinyin-dict.json`: Maps Chinese words to their pinyin pronunciations
- `multiple-dict.json`: Handles context-specific pronunciations for characters with multiple readings
